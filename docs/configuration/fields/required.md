# Using the `required` Argument

Fields may be linked/required/folded according to a/multiple parent value(s). This is accomplished by appending a 
`required` argument to the [field](../objects/field.md). Required can be very powerful, but due to the complexity requires 
some careful consideration when using.

## Example Config

To link a field's visibility to the value of another:
    
```php
array(
    'required' => array( 'LINKED_FIELD_ID', 'OPERATION', 'VALUE' )
)
```

|Key|Description|
|--|--|
|`LINKED_FIELD_ID`|Field ID that will affect the visibility of this field|
|`OPERATION`|Comparison operation to perform|
|`VALUE`|Value is the value to compare against for visibility|

You can also link a field with multiple "parent" required values. If all of these conditions are not met, this 
[field](../objects/field.md) will not be visible and the [field](../objects/field.md#output) CSS will not be used. 
An example is as follows:

    
```php
array(
    'required' => array( 
        array( 'LINKED_FIELD_ID_1', 'OPERATION_1', 'VALUE_1' ), 
        array( 'LINKED_FIELD_ID_2', 'OPERATION_2', 'VALUE_2' ) 
    )
)
```

## Operations Available

To attempt to support the various possibilities, a number of options have been coded. These operations have been found to
support the majority of needs.

|Operation|Test Equivalent|
|--- |--- |
|=|`$a = $b`|
|equals|`$a = $b`|
|!=|`$a != $b`|
|not|`$a != $b`|
|>|`$a > $b`|
|greater|`$a > $b`|
|is_larger|`$a > $b`|
|>=|$`a >= $b`|
|greater_equal|`$a >= $b`|
|is_larger_equal|`$a >= $b`|
|<|`$a < $b`|
|less|`$a < $b`|
|is_smaller|`$a < $b`|
|<=|`$a <= $b`|
|less_equal|`$a <= $b`|
|is_smaller_equal|`$a <= $b`|
|contains|`( strpos( $a, $b ) !== false )`|
|doesnt_contain|`( strpos($a, $b) === false )`|
|not_contain|`( strpos($a, $b) === false )`|
|is_empty_or|`if ( empty( $value1 )`|
|not_empty_and|`if ( !empty( $value1 ) && $value1 != $value2 )`|

    

## Nesting
    
As of Redux 3.2.0 nested requireds fully function. If any parent is hidden or doesn't match the value, all children are 
hidden and all CSS output from those children is hidden as well.

 


## CSS Output

CSS output to both the head and compiler is removed from each field if the required value(s) is/are not met. You can, 
however, override this on a per field basis by setting `'force_output' => true` for each field you want CSS to still be 
output with. This way you can nest a field under another, and still have it output to the dynamic CSS.

::: tip
The CSS output will always be visible if items are within a `section` field unless that specific field has the required value set to the required parent as well.
