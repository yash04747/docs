# Using TGM Plugin Activation
The best way to install Redux is to use the TGM Plugin Activation class. This class allows you to encourage the user to
install Redux as a plugin rather than embedding it in your theme or plugin. Why would you want to do that?

- The WordPress plugin is kept up to date and addresses any new vulnerabilities.
- You don't have to worry about updating it.
- We're rabid about support.
- It's a whole lot less pain during your code reviews.

Depending on the market (ThemeForest, WordPress.org), the pain of embedding can be quite intense. As such, this
is the recommended approach by Redux.
