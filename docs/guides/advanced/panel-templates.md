# Panel Templates
As of Redux <strong>3.4.3+</strong>, the Redux templates have been decoupled from the core. That means that ANY 
developer can take the template files and override them for their own customized Redux panel.

## How's it done?
To do this is simple. First, copy the templates from `~/ReduxCore/templates/panel` to a different location.

::: danger
Never, ever, **EVER** modify ReduxCore. Always move things out of the core to make modifications.
:::

Tell Redux where these new new files are, via the `templates_path` argument. That's it!

#### What if you change something?
Our templates use the same versioning of other products. If your panel is in `dev_mode` a notice will be displayed in the panel
when a template file has been updated in the core.

## Won't this Change All Panels?
We built Redux so each panel may have it's own set of templates. It's all powered by the `opt_name` key.  Your customizations 
are yours and yours aloneAs long as as keys are  not shared with another panel.
