# Getting Started

There are several different methods to quickly begin using Redux, each targeted toward different skill levels and use cases. Read 
through to see what suits your particular needs.

## Installing
Redux must be installed to begin using it. The quickest approach is to install the WordPress.org plugin although other 
approaches are available. [Read more in our install docs](basics-install.md).

## Core Concepts
Another great guide to review is our core concepts.  The Redux may be confusing without understanding how it's structured. [Read more in our core concepts docs](basics-core-concepts.md)

## Basic Config
Once Redux is installed, we can begin digging in. Let's begin with a basic config. The [barebones example](https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework/blob/master/sample/barebones-config.php) 
or the more extensive [sample config](https://github.com/reduxframework/redux-framework/blob/master/sample/sample-config.php) may be modified as needed. 
We hope you'll customize our examples and adapt them to suit your needs.

```php
<?php
    if ( ! class_exists( 'Redux' ) ) {
        return;
    }

    $opt_name = 'redux_demo';

    $theme = wp_get_theme(); // For use with some settings. Not necessary.

    $args = array(
        'display_name'         => $theme->get( 'Name' ),
        'display_version'      => $theme->get( 'Version' ),
        'menu_title'           => esc_html__( 'Sample Options', 'redux-framework-demo' ),
        'customizer'           => true,
    );

    Redux::set_args( $opt_name, $args );

    Redux::set_section( $opt_name, array(
        'title'  => esc_html__( 'Basic Field', 'redux-framework-demo' ),
        'id'     => 'basic',
        'desc'   => esc_html__( 'Basic field with no subsections.', 'redux-framework-demo' ),
        'icon'   => 'el el-home',
        'fields' => array(
            array(
                'id'       => 'opt-text',
                'type'     => 'text',
                'title'    => esc_html__( 'Example Text', 'redux-framework-demo' ),
                'desc'     => esc_html__( 'Example description.', 'redux-framework-demo' ),
                'subtitle' => esc_html__( 'Example subtitle.', 'redux-framework-demo' ),
                'hint'     => array(
                    'content' => 'This is a <b>hint</b> tool-tip for the text field.<br/><br/>Add any HTML based text you like here.',
                )
            )
        )
    ) );
```
